*Introduction*


Hybrid Electric Vehicles contributes to fuel savings and emission reduction aims, which ultimately reduces energy consumption. The aim of this project is to develop efficient powertrain control for hybrid vehicles to reduce energy consumption during heavy traffic. The approach is to reduce fuel consumption by switching between electric drive and internal combustion engine during traffic scenario. The change in acceleration helps to find the velocity which in turn determines the position of the subject vehicle which is also dependent on the vehicle ahead of the subject vehicle. This calculation considers the efficiency of electric drive and internal combustion engine as well at different velocities and done.
